# Overview of Project ☁️

In this project, we'll be creating a text narrator using Amazon Polly. You’ll upload a piece of text (such as a book, article, or newsletter) to an Amazon S3 bucket, and it will be converted to speech. You can also customize the voice, pitch, and speed parameters.

# Steps to be performed 
In the next few lessons, we'll be going through the following steps.

Exploring Amazon Polly
Creating an IAM role
Creating an S3 Bucket
Writing Lambda function code
Checking the output of Amazon Polly
