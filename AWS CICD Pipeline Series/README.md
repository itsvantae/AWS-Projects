# Deploying CI/CD Pipeline Using AWS Services 

# Overview of Project ‚òÅÔ∏è
This series focuses on deploying a CI/CD pipeline using AWS services. The pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying applications, ensuring efficient and reliable delivery of code changes. By leveraging AWS services, we can create a robust CI/CD pipeline that facilitates continuous integration and continuous delivery, streamlining the software development lifecycle.

# Steps to be Performed
We'll be going through the following steps to complete our project:

Setting Up Cloud9: Create an IDE environment using Cloud9 to explore the fundamentals of building a web app.
[Project 1](https://bit.ly/3XYmWUJ)

Setting Up CodeCommit: Create a Git repository using AWS CodeCommit and configure it for version control.
[Project 2](https://bit.ly/4eeRFSV)

Securing Project Dependencies: Use AWS CodeArtifact to manage and secure your project dependencies.
[Project 3](https://bit.ly/3ZEm8W9)

Packaging the Application: Use AWS CodeBuild to package your application for deployment.
[Project 4](https://bit.ly/3ZGoFPM)

Deploying the Application: Use AWS CodeDeploy to deploy your application to the target environment.
[Project 5](https://bit.ly/3N1fSjI)

Automating Deployments: Use AWS CloudFormation to automate the deployment of your infrastructure and application resources.
[Project 6](https://bit.ly/3TQ8rj4)

Creating the CI/CD Pipeline: Set up a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
[Project 7](https://bit.ly/4erIaAb)
