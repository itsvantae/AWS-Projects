# Deploying CI/CD Pipeline Using AWS Services ‚òÅÔ∏è
Overview of Project
This series focuses on deploying a CI/CD pipeline using AWS services. The pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying applications, ensuring efficient and reliable delivery of code changes. By leveraging AWS services, we can create a robust CI/CD pipeline that facilitates continuous integration and continuous delivery, streamlining the software development lifecycle.

Steps to be Performed
We'll be going through the following steps to complete our project:

Setting Up CodeCommit: Create a repository and configure it for version control.

Building the Application with CodeBuild: Set up a build project that compiles the application and runs tests.
Link to Project 2

Creating the CI/CD Pipeline: Configure AWS CodePipeline to connect CodeCommit and CodeBuild, automating the build process.
Link to Project 3

Deploying with CodeDeploy: Set up CodeDeploy to manage the deployment of the built application to the target environment.
