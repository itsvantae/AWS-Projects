# Overview of Project ‚òÅÔ∏è

In this project, we'll be creating a text narrator using Amazon Polly. You‚Äôll upload a piece of text (such as a book, article, or newsletter) to an Amazon S3 bucket, and it will be converted to speech. You can also customize the voice, pitch, and speed parameters.

# Steps to be performed 
We'll be going through the following steps to complete our project :

1. Exploring Amazon Polly
2. Creating an IAM role
3. Creating an S3 Bucket
4. Writing Lambda function code
5. Checking the output of Amazon Polly
