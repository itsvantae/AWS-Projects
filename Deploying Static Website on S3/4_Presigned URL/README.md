# Securely sharing an object using a presigned URL
When you need to temporarily and securely share an object with someone, you can create a presigned URL. While creating the URL, you'll set the duration for which it remains valid. After that, you can share the URL with the users who need access to the object.

As long as the presigned URL is valid, anyone with it can access the object. Be sure to limit the URL's validity period to what's necessary and only share it with trusted individuals.
