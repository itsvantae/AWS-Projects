# Configuring a static website on Amazon S3 

# Overview of Project ☁️
This project focuses on hosting a static website using Amazon S3. Static websites include HTML pages, images, style sheets, and other files necessary for rendering a website. Unlike dynamic websites, static websites do not rely on server-side scripting or databases, though they may use client-side scripts that execute in the user’s web browser.
