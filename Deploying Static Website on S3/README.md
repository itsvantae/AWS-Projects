# Configuring a static website on Amazon S3 

# 
Static websites can contain HTML pages, images, style sheets, and all files that are needed to render a website. Static websites do not use server-side scripting or a database. However, they may contain client-side scripts that run in a user's web browser. 

You can host a static website on Amazon S3 by uploading the content and making it readable by users. No servers are needed, and you can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time from anywhere on the web.
