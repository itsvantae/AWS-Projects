# Build a daily task scheduler application using Amazon PartyRock

# Project Overview: ‚òÅÔ∏è
In this project, we'll be using PartyRock to develop a 'Daily Task Scheduler Application' that enhances productivity and organization. PartyRock, powered by Amazon Bedrock, is a fun and intuitive generative AI app-building playground. It enables you to create a variety of apps without needing any coding experience, making it accessible to everyone, not just developers.

PartyRock is designed to empower builders of all levels by providing a simple and engaging way to start creating with generative AI. With just a few easy steps, you can experiment with different AI models, learn how to craft effective AI prompts, and share the applications you create.

Building and experimenting with PartyRock not only gives you hands-on experience with AI but also helps you understand how to leverage its capabilities effectively. I've been exploring PartyRock recently and found it incredibly fun to use, and I'm excited for you to experience it too while building this project.

# Steps to be performed: 
We'll be going through the following steps to create our project:

1. Generating the daily task scheduler application
2. Changes in existing widgets
3. Adding new widgets
4. Publishing your app

# Services Used üõ†
AWS PartyRock: A user-friendly platform from AWS that lets you create AI-powered apps easily, without any coding skills. It‚Äôs designed to help you build and experiment with applications using generative AI in a straightforward and enjoyable way.

5. We just created an application without any coding pre-requisites, using prompt engineering in less than 5 minutes !
6. We can also customize applications created by others by clicking the 'Remix' button at the top right of the application page, allowing us to make a copy and 
   modify it according to our preferences.

In the next step, we'll begin building our Application by modifying the existing components and introducing some new ones.

# Generating the daily task scheduler application
1. Navigate to AWS PartyRock : https://partyrock.aws/
2. Click on ‚ÄòBuild your own app‚Äô and enter an appropriate prompt.

4. PartyRock created an application that accepts tasks as input, prioritizes them to generate a schedule, and even includes a chatbot to help refine your plan!

In the next section, let's try modifying the existing components to make them more specific.
