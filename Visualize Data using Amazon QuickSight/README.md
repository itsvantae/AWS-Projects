# Overview of Project ☁️
Amazon QuickSight is a fully managed cloud-scale business intelligence service that is powered by machine learning and allows you to create data visualizations and dashboards for the people you work with, wherever they are.

In this project, you'll explore how to create visualizations using Amazon QuickSight with a large dataset stored in Amazon S3. Specifically, you'll work with a dataset containing information on 50,000 of the best-selling products on Amazon.com.

# Step #1: Download the Dataset
*  Download the "Amazon Bestseller Dataset.csv" file along with the "manifest.json" file to your local machine.
*  Click on "raw" and Control+S to save both files onto your computer.

# Step #2: Store the Dataset in Amazon S3
* Open the Amazon S3 console and click "Create Bucket".
* Name the bucket and keep the settings as default.
