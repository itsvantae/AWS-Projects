# Build a language translation bot using Amazon Lex 

# Overview of Project ☁️
In this project, we’ll be developing an image labels generator using Amazon Rekognition. It’s going to be an exciting challenge! Once completed, your application will have the ability to recognize and label images automatically. For example, if you upload a photo of a bag, Amazon Rekognition will detect and label the image as a bag.

# Steps to be performed 
We'll be going through the following steps to complete our project

1. Creating an Amazon S3 Bucket
2. Uploading images to the S3 Bucket
3. Installing configuring the AWS Command line interface (CLI)
4. Importing libraries
5. Adding detect_labels function
6. Adding main function
7. Running your python file
