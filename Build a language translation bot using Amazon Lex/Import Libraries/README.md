# Importing Libraries
1. Open your preferred IDE(VSCode etc.) to and create a .py file for performing your coding.
2. Open a terminal and install the libraries needed for this project.
   ```sh
   pip install boto3
   pip install matplotlib
   ```
4. Let's import the necessary libraries. We need:
   - boto3 for interacting with AWS services.
   - matplotlib for visualization.
   - PIL (Python Imaging Library) for handling image data.
   - BytesIO from the io module to work with image data.

5. Add the below code in your .py file.
   ```sh
   import boto3
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import matplotlib.patches as patches
   from PIL import Image
   from io import BytesIO
   ```
