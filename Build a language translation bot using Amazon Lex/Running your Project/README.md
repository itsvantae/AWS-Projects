# Running your Python file
1. Open the terminal in the directory where your Python file is present and run the command:

   ```sh
    python name_of_python_file.py
   ```
2. You will get an output with the number of detected labels and their confidence levels and a pop-up screen displaying the image that was uploaded on your S3 bucket 
   with the bounding boxes present on the generated labels.
