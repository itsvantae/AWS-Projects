7. You can choose the language you want to communicate with the bot and can also choose between different voice interaction modules.
8. The Intent classification confidence score threshold acts as a confidence bar that the system uses to determine whether it’s confident enough about the user’s 
   intent. For now, let’s leave it at the default setting and click "Done".
