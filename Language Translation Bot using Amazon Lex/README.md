# Develop a text narrator using Amazon Polly 

# Overview of Project ‚òÅÔ∏è
In this project, we'll build a language translation bot using Amazon Lex.

To translate a word or sentence into another language, simply type it into the chatbot, and it will provide the translation.

# Steps to be performed 
We'll be going through the following steps to complete our project:

1. Creating an empty chatbot
2. Specifying intents and slots
3. Specify Fulfilment
4. Create an IAM role
5. Create a Lambda function
6. Test the Lambda function
