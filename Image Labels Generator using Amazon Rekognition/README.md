# Build an image labels generator using Amazon Rekognition

# Overview of Project ‚òÅÔ∏è
In this project, we‚Äôll be developing an image labels generator using Amazon Rekognition. It‚Äôs going to be an exciting challenge! Once completed, your application will have the ability to recognize and label images automatically. For example, if you upload a photo of a bag, Amazon Rekognition will detect and label the image as a bag.

# Steps to be performed 
We'll be going through the following steps to complete our project :

1. Creating an Amazon S3 Bucket
2. Uploading images to the S3 Bucket
3. Installing configuring the AWS Command line interface (CLI)
4. Importing libraries
5. Adding detect_labels function
6. Adding main function
7. Running your python file

# Services Used üõ†
* Amazon S3: For storing the images in the process of generating labels.
* Amazon Rekognition: To analyse images and generate image labels.
* AWS CLI: Interacting with AWS services through command line interface(CLI).
