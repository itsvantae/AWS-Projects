# Overview of Project ☁️
In this project, you will design and implement a multi-tier web application architecture on AWS. The primary goal is to create a robust, scalable, and secure environment that meets the best practices for modern cloud architecture. By leveraging AWS services, you will build an application infrastructure that maximizes availability, enhances security, and supports the seamless scaling of resources.

# Project Goals
Scalability: Implement an architecture that can automatically scale up or down based on demand.
Availability: Ensure that the application remains highly available, even in the event of failures in certain components.
Security: Secure the application by isolating different layers of the architecture and applying strict security controls.
