# Exploring file versions
Bucket versioning is off by default, meaning changes to objects can't be undoneâ€”replacing or deleting a file permanently loses the original. When versioning is enabled, all versions of files, including deleted ones, are saved, allowing you to recover previous versions. While you can't turn off versioning once it's on, you can suspend it. When you created your bucket, you enabled versioning. In this task, you'll view the available object versions in your bucket. 

For more details, refer [Using versioning in S3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html)

1. Return to the Amazon S3 console, and choose the Objects tab.
2. Choose  Show versions to turn on bucket versioning.
3. Review the list of objects in the bucket.

Each file has a Version ID, automatically generated by Amazon S3 when versioning is enabled. You'll find two versions of the `index.html` file since you uploaded a new version. The current version is the one you uploaded when updating your website.
